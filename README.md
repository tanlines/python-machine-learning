# OpenCV Object Detection

Source code and data set for detecting objects in the video game Old School Runescape. 

Adapted from https://github.com/learncodebygaming/opencv_tutorials to use multiprocessing.

To run the program, you need to use OpenCV to generate a positive results vector and train a model with the included data set.
